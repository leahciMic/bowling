# Bowling Game [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leahciMic/bowling.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/leahciMic/bowling)

This project is for a technical coding test.

The code can be found in `bowling.js` in the root directory.

The objective is to provide an object with two methods (`roll()`, and `score()`). The purpose is to track the score of an ordinary game of ten pin bowling. `roll()` will be called with the amount of pins knocked down from each throw, `score()` will return the current game score.

I have included some unit tests in `specs/` that helped me ensure I was scoring games correctly. To run the tests, simply checkout this repo, and run `npm test`.

Thanks for the exciting code challege!
